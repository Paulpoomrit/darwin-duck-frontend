## Darwin The Duck - Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [`Remix`](https://remix.run/).

It includes a single React component to start your project with, a sample [`codux.config.json`](codux.config.json) with preconfigured keys, a `package.json` file to describe the project's packages and dependencies, and a folder and component structure to put everything neatly in its place.

- Edit, render and compose apps that make use of **`React`**-based components.
- Create components with **`TypeScript`**, **`SCSS`** and **`CSS Modules`** support.
- Visually edit in real-time and in an isolated environment.
